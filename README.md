# Tournament_Management_System
Tournament Management system for maintaining sports in a better and easier way. Traditionally when a tournament is organized storing and processing of data with paperwork is so difficult. To remove this drawback we developed this tournament management system for maintaining sports. This project is functionalized to organize teams for adding, editing, removing and so on.  Teams' data are managed in a good manner. We designed, developed, and created a database in part by part for handling this project. Our main goal is to solve this real-life problem more functionally.

# Objectives

# Conclusion
Our main motive for creating, developing, and building this project is to make the work easy for managing tournament teams. We applied various technologies and methods throughout this journey. This should be very useful and enjoyable as well. We faced so many difficulties in developing this project and our honorable mentor Hasi Saha mam helped us a lot. We learned new technologies, gained knowledge, and applied them to complete this project. We will work on this project and will make this project more functional soon.
